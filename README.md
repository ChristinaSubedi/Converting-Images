The name of this project is inspired by the open source project convert, a command line tool for image manipulation. As the original convert project contains very extensive work, the version only covers a fraction of convertâ€™s features. 

The selected tasks are 
1) reading and writing images,
2) simple image manipulation e.g. rotating an image and
3) performing a flood fill operation you may know as the paint bucket tool in image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP or Microsoft Paint.


To start the GUI, you can use the command:

./bin/convert gui

In the GUI, you will find a button on the lefthand side for each functionality. Click on the corresponding button to test with the pre-loaded sample image.
